# Hospitality-Analysis-PowerBI
Worked on the 1st challenge from CodeBasics Resume Project Challenges, aimed at providing insights to the revenue team in the hospitality domain.
It was a really informative project that revealed several industry terminologies and best practices, which have been inculcated in final result.

### Measures and calculations created using DAX:
1. Realisation Percentage 
2. RevPar - Realisation Per Available Room
3. ADR - Average Daily Rate
4. DSRN - Daily Sellable Room Nights
5. DBRN - Daily Booked Room Nights
6. DURN - Daily Utilized Room Nights
7. Booking breakdown by platforms and room type
8. Cancellation and No Shows percentage
9. Occupancy
and more.

### Workflow:
1. Data Loading & Transformation - Evaluated the data quality and removed any inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. Data Modeling - Created relationships between multiple sources, to create a star schema.
3. Visualizations - Created visuals to convey the business performance using KPIs and their Week-over-Week percentage change. Performance evaluations using hotel type, key metric trends, occupancy, average ratings and more. 

Additional aspects included:
1. Tool tips for all the KPIs, providing a quick view of their movement over time.
2. Data definitions at the bottom of the reports, for easy understanding of the subject matter and data presented.
